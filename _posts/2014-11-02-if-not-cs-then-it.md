title: if (major != 'CS') {major = 'IT'}

This one's more of a thought dump than a post.  Honestly, I don't know what I'm talking about.  Let's just get that out of the way real quick.  I'm a newly-married college kid who's holding down his first real job while trying to manage a computer science degree.  I'm kinda wondering at this point if I want that degree.

There are a number of thoughts I've been having lately.  I'm having these thoughts because of two computer theory classes I'm taking.  I just can't seem to understand finite state machines, context-free grammars, and/or Turing machines.  Honestly, I feel pretty stupid.  It seems like most of the people in my classes understand what's going on and I just don't.  Thankfully, I have a couple friends that are also struggling (to varying degrees), but that simply serves to complicate my already-muddled thoughts.

I don't know what I need to do or even what I should be thinking which is why I'm writing.  I'm tempted to publish my thoughts over the coming week(s), but that's not my main goal in typing this file.  I really just want to get my thoughts on paper so that I can get them out of my head.

Okay.  Enough rambling.  The cheese of the matter is that I don't know what I want to do with school.  Honestly, I don't want to be here, but I *do* want to be able to provide for my wife and any future family that may come along.

Running with the assumption that college is a good thing and that I should go through with it and earn a degree, the question arises of which degree I should "run" with.  I like computers.  I know that for a fact.  I've been fascinated by them since I was four and played with my dad's first laptop.  When I say I "like" computers, I don't mean that I want to study microchips or how electrons move or why hard drives work.  I enjoy knowing little facts about those topics, but I certainly don't want to spend the rest of my life engineering hardware or figuring out how to make the internet faster on a physics level.  I enjoy *software*.

One of my first loves as a child was playing with LEGO bricks.  I adored (and still do) the infinite possibilities offered by those tiny, interlocking pieces of plastic.  One day, a single brick can be part of an airplane.  Another day could allocate that piece to a car or a pully or a robot.  I see programming in a similar light.  Programming, to me, is like building LEGOs without the limitation of which pieces are in my bin.  Programming doesn't necessarily need resources.  If I need another variable for a program, I don't need to go out and buy it, I just *make* it.  It's just there.  Instantly.  I can then use that variable to represent annual income, available plane flights, phone numbers, health for a video game character, you name it!

That's beautiful to me.

What I *don't* like is theory.  As my mother can attest, I've never enjoyed doing things for the sake of doing them.  If I don't see a point (by "point," I mean something useful that I or the world can gain from my actions), I don't want to do whatever it is you want me to do.  As I mentioned before, I'm currently enrolled in two computational theory classes.  They're kicking my butt.  Not only are they difficult, but they're boring.  I don't see the point which makes me motivating myself to do the work needed that much more difficult.  I fully realize this one's on me, but it's a problem nonetheless.  I can't just flip a switch in my brain and magically be a perfect student.  I don't think humans work like that.

I'm the kind of person who needs to talk things out with both myself and other people; hence my blog.  I love getting other people's opinions.  I've currently got a few friends offering their thoughts on my situation.  There's a couple pushing for me to stay in computer science and finish even if I don't really like it.  This is a valid thought.  My goal in writing this is certainly not to convince myself that they're wrong.  My dad really struggled with parts of medical school.  He knows the pain of having to push through theory and difficult subjects in the name of finishing.  We've spoken rather candidly about this in the past.  The other influencing people are information technology majors who're gunning for their major.  From what I can tell, information technology is a major similar to computer science but significantly simpler and much more broad.

The thing that's got my mind churning right now is that I don't just want money out of life.  I'd also like to enjoy it and have time to spend with those I love doing what I love.  If computer science is going to land me in a position where I can't do that, then I don't want any part of it.  If information technology lands me in a better spot, that definitely sounds better.

I'm gonna kick things around for a few more days and see how I feel.

**Update (November 6, 2014):** I went with information technology.  Thought about it more and it just seemed to make sense.  Plus, I sorta want to have an emphasis in computer security which is contained within the information technology major at BYU.  I suppose we'll see how this goes.  Bye, bye, theory!
