I recently bought a [Pebble smartwatch](http://www.getpebble.com/). I'm not a watch person. I tried to wear a watch a few years ago, destroyed it with my sweat, and gave up. I can't really explain why the Pebble caught my eye. I don't even remember reading about it for the first time. I have a hunch that my infatuation with the little device stemmed from my childhood crush on [these things](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Virtual_Pet).

I've hardly taken my watch off since I got it. I have the [Fresh Green](https://getpebble.com/freshhotfly) Pebble and adore it. Since the mailman handed me my watch, I've purchased a more stylish [NATO strap](http://natostrapsco.com/collections/22mm-straps/products/the-watchuseek-f71-edition-nato-strap) for my little buddy and programmed myself a [Big Hero 6-themed](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax) watch face.

As one who is very wary of shattered iPhone screens, I was getting tired of pulling my phone out each and every time I wanted to check a notification, change my currently-playing song, or end a Bluetooth'd call. Now that I've got this neat-o indestructable watch, I just glance at my wrist and click a button to accomplish each one of those tasks. Between my Pebble and Yosemite's iMessage-to-SMS functionality, my phone now hibernates in my pocket almost all day. That alone makes the purchase worth it for me, not to mention the vibrating alarms that I have yet to sleep though.

One of the biggest things that attracted me to Pebble was the fact that I could code my own "apps" for it without having to shell out extra money for a "developer account" or deal with the terror of rejection from an app store. I got **way** excited when I found out that there was an official [JavaScript framework](http://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/) for developing Pebble apps. I tried it out as soon as my watch arrived.

It sucked.

It was too slow. Things drawn to the Pebble screen took visible time to draw. There was a noticable lag between button presses and response. It just felt messy.

I didn't particularly want to learn how to work in C. I don't like C++. I like JavaScript. Yeah, I'm one of those guys.  But, as shown by the fact that I've programmed a [Baymax watch face](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax), I'm figuring out this C thing.

And I like it.

**That's** the thing that surprised and please me most about my Pebble watch. Learning how to work efficiently with lower-level languages to do cool things on a watch while still maintaining the Pebble's beautiful 5-7 **day** battery life has proven to be a fun puzzle.

For example, I originally had fifteen frames in my Baymax watch face for the blinking animation.  That didn't work out so well once I discovered that the Pebble's display can only render 30fps (note that I say "only" in the context of desktop vs. watch rendering; the fact that such a simple **watch** can render 30fps makes me geek out).  I moved to three frames instead of fifteen and then dropped to two in the name of battery life.  It's been fun to see how various coding practices actually impact daily use.  Let me tell you, those fifteen frames running every ten seconds really killed my battery!

I'm currently in the process of putting together a dungeon-crawling game for my Pebble.  There's already a couple similar games on the Pebble "store," but I'm just not satisfied with them.  I'm a user experience designer/graphic designer by profession and couldn't help but see improvements that could be made. Plus, I'm looking for any and every opportunity to learn the innards of this little contraption I've got strapped to my wrist. Keep your eye out if you like the idea of casually killing giant spiders during your work day.

On that note, get out and buy yourself a [Pebble](http://www.getpebble.com/)!
