Sometimes GIFs are better than words. That's why I made [Jeph](http://www.jessemillar.com/jeph/).

Jeph is a weekend project I put together to effectively run my own version of [Giphy](http://www.giphy.com/) on GitHub Pages.

I didn't want the process of uploading GIFs to Jeph to kill the fun of quickly building a GIF collection, so I tried to make it as easy as possible to add new ones. Just chuck whatever GIFs you want in the /gifs folder inside folders named whatever you want your homepage categories to be called. When you're done, run the "jepherize.sh" script.

    $ ./jepherize.sh

This will create static preview images of each GIF (because bandwidth is an endangered animal) and create a JSON "database" of the filenames. The .sh script is necessary since GitHub Pages doesn't give us any sort of dynamic database.

[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) is a required dependancy. When you run the "jepherize.sh" script, ImageMagick goes through and creates new preview images from the first frame of each GIF and shoves them in the /previews folder.

Source code, as always, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jessemillar/jeph). Feel free to fork, pull, whatevs.

Enjoy!
