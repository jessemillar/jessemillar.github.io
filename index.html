		The name's Jesse.  Jesse <b>Millar</b> if you simply <b>must</b> know.  I'm a pretty cool guy. I'm basically addicted to programming and game design. I longboard. <b>A LOT.</b> Oh, and I can't get fat.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>I've tried.</center>
		<br>
		Projects?  Yeah.  I've got projects.  Not too long ago, I decided I <a href = "http://youtu.be/MejbOFk7H6c" target = "_blank">needed</a> a way to quickly make HTML5 games. HTML5 is <b>cool</b>. JavaScript is <b>cool</b>. Game engines are <b>cool</b>. There had to be a <b>cool</b> JavaScript game engine for HTML5, right? Turns out there are plenty of <b>cool</b> JavaScript game engines, but I didn't really like any of them.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>No, no, it's not you. It's me.</center>
		<br>
		<i>Lorina</i> is my own JavaScript game engine that tries to do what other game engines couldn't: Make sense to my crazy brain. In making it, I tried to make everything simple and memorable. Basically, I wanted <i>Lorina</i> to have a lemme-do-this-and-get-out-of-your-way attitude.
		<br>
		<br>
		As for <i>Lorina's</i> name and logo, you should know that I really dig <u><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></u>. Lorina is named after <i>Lorina Charlotte Liddell</i>, sister of <i>Alice Pleasance Liddell</i>. The fictional <i>Alice</i> is based off this real <i>Alice</i>. Her sister <i>Lorina</i> has a cameo appearance as the <u><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lory_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)">Lory</a></u> in Wonderland. A <u><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lories_and_lorikeets">lory</a></u> is a "type" of parrot, so I drew a parrot.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>Parrots are <b>cool</b>.</center>
		<br>
		Oh, before I forget, the whole project is open-sourced (within <u><a href = "https://github.com/jessemillar/Lorina/blob/master/LICENSE.md">licensing limitations</a></u>) on its <u><a href = "https://github.com/jessemillar/Lorina">GitHub page</a></u>. Keep in mind that <i>Lorina's</i> still young which means not much is set in stone. <a href = "http://youtu.be/fv7qU-MnMS8" target = "_blank">Whatever</a>. Here's a couple of <u><a href = "http://www.jessemillar.com/lab/lorina/">demo</a></u> <u><a href = "http://www.jessemillar.com/lab/lorina/physics/">pages</a></u>. Proper documentation is on its way. Have fun, hackers!
