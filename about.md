[Wassup, homes](http://youtu.be/2EBCe-lPprs).  Kick back, relax, and smoke this bubble pipe.  There's some chocolate milk on the coffee table if you'd like.

The name's Jesse.  Jesse **Millar**.  I'm a pretty cool guy. I'm basically addicted to programming and game design. I'm an information technology student at BYU.  I currently get paid to design better user experiences for Edge Services.  I longboard. I dig penguins.  I draw.  I like [my wife](http://www.twitter.com/stephiemillar) **A LOT.**

Oh, and I can't get fat.  I've tried.
