I bought a [Pebble smartwatch](http://www.getpebble.com/) a few weeks ago. I'm not a watch person. I tried to wear a watch a few years ago, destroyed it with my sweat, and gave up. I can't really explain why the Pebble caught my eye. I don't even remember reading about it for the first time. I have a hunch that my love of the little device stemmed from [these things](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Virtual_Pet). Man, I loved those as a kid.

I've hardly taken my watch off since I got it. I ordered the [Fresh Green](https://getpebble.com/freshhotfly) Pebble and love it. I've since purchased a slightly more stylish [NATO strap](http://natostrapsco.com/collections/22mm-straps/products/the-watchuseek-f71-edition-nato-strap) for the little buddy and programmed myself a [Big Hero 6-themed](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax) watch face.

I was worried about the programming aspect of the Pebble. One of the biggest things that attracted me to Pebble was the fact that I could code my own "apps" for it without having to shell out extra money or deal with the terror of rejection from an app store. I got **way** excited when I found out that there was an official [JavaScript framework](http://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/) for developing Pebble apps. I tried it out as soon as my watch arrived.

It sucked.

It was too slow. Things drawn to the Pebble screen took visible time to draw. There was a noticable lag between button presses and response. It just felt messy.

That's where my concerns came in. I didn't particularly want to learn how to work in C. I don't like C++. I like JavaScript. Yeah, I'm one of those guys.  But, as shown by the fact that I've programmed a [Baymax watch face](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax), I'm figuring out this C thing.

And I like it.

**That's** the thing that surprised me the most about my Pebble watch. Learning how to work efficiently with lower-level languages to do cool things on a watch while still maintaining the Pebble's beautiful 5-7 **day** battery life has proven to be a fun puzzle.
