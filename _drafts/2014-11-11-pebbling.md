I bought a [Pebble smartwatch](http://www.getpebble.com/) a few weeks ago. I'm not a watch person. I tried to wear a watch a few years ago, destroyed it with my sweat, and gave up. I can't really explain why the Pebble caught my eye. I don't even remember reading about it for the first time. I have a hunch that my love of the little device stemmed from [these things](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Virtual_Pet). Man, I loved those as a kid.

I've hardly taken my watch off since I got it. I ordered the [Fresh Green](https://getpebble.com/freshhotfly) Pebble and adore it. I've since purchased a slightly more stylish [NATO strap](http://natostrapsco.com/collections/22mm-straps/products/the-watchuseek-f71-edition-nato-strap) for the little buddy and programmed myself a [Big Hero 6-themed](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax) watch face.

I was worried about the programming aspect of the Pebble. One of the biggest things that attracted me to Pebble was the fact that I could code my own "apps" for it without having to shell out extra money or deal with the terror of rejection from an app store. I got **way** excited when I found out that there was an official [JavaScript framework](http://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/) for developing Pebble apps. I tried it out as soon as my watch arrived.

It sucked.

It was too slow. Things drawn to the Pebble screen took visible time to draw. There was a noticable lag between button presses and response. It just felt messy.

That's where my concerns came in. I didn't particularly want to learn how to work in C. I don't like C++. I like JavaScript. Yeah, I'm one of those guys.  But, as shown by the fact that I've programmed a [Baymax watch face](https://github.com/jessemillar/Baymax), I'm figuring out this C thing.

And I like it.

**That's** the thing that surprised me the most about my Pebble watch. Learning how to work efficiently with lower-level languages to do cool things on a watch while still maintaining the Pebble's beautiful 5-7 **day** battery life has proven to be a fun puzzle.

For example, I originally had fifteen frames in the Baymax watch face for the blinking animation.  That didn't work out so well once I discovered that the Pebble's display can only render 30fps (note that I say "only" in the context of desktop/watch rendering; the fact that such a simple **watch** can render 30fps makes me geek out).  I moved to three frames instead and then dropped to two in the name of battery life.  It's been cool to actually test my watch face over the last couple of days to see how various coding practices actually impact daily use.  Let me tell you, those fifteen frames running every ten seconds really killed my battery!

I'm currently in the process of putting together a simple dungeon-crawling game for my Pebble.  There's already a couple similar games on the Pebble "store," but I'm just not satisfied with them.  I'm a user experience designer/graphic designer by profession and couldn't stand some of the design choices those devs made. Plus, I'm looking for any and every opportunity to learn the innards of this little contraption I've got strapped to my wrist.
