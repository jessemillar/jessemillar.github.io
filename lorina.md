Projects?  Yeah.  I've got projects.  Not too long ago, I decided I [needed](http://youtu.be/MejbOFk7H6c) a way to quickly make HTML5 games. HTML5 is **cool**. JavaScript is **cool**. Game engines are **cool**. There had to be a **cool** JavaScript game engine for HTML5, right? Turns out there are plenty of **cool** JavaScript game engines, but I didn't really like any of them.

No, no, it's not you. It's me.

*Lorina* is my own JavaScript game engine that tries to do what other game engines couldn't: Make sense to my crazy brain. In making it, I tried to make everything simple and memorable. Basically, I wanted *Lorina* to have a lemme-do-this-and-get-out-of-your-way attitude.

As for *Lorina's* name and logo, you should know that I really dig [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland"). Lorina is named after *Lorina Charlotte Liddell*, sister of *Alice Pleasance Liddell*. The fictional *Alice* is based off this real *Alice*. Her sister *Lorina* has a cameo appearance as the [Lory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lory_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)) in Wonderland. A [lory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lories_and_lorikeets) is a "type" of parrot, so I drew a parrot.

Parrots are **cool**.

Oh, before I forget, the whole project is open-sourced (within [licensing limitations](https://github.com/jessemillar/Lorina/blob/master/LICENSE.md)) on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/jessemillar/Lorina). Keep in mind that *Lorina's* still young which means not much is set in stone. [Whatever](http://youtu.be/fv7qU-MnMS8). Here's a couple of [demo](http://www.jessemillar.com/lab/lorina/) [pages](http://www.jessemillar.com/lab/lorina/physics/). Proper documentation is on its way. Have fun, hackers!
